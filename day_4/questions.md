## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    * Methods help write code faster. They are shortcuts for things you want to be able to call on later or not have to write the condition for each time.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello(name)
  "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone(darby)
````
1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

    * I understand methods right now. I want more practice with challenging scenarios to help my understanding.
