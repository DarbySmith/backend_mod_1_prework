## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

    * A conditional statement is like a fork in the road and depending on the conditions different scenarios will play out. Conditionals can be used to determine if you have enough money to buy something, ingredients to cook something, if you qualify for a competition or many others.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

    * You want to use an if statement when you only want certain situations to happen under specfic conditions. The if statement can implement the situations into the code.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
    * if variable condition
        desired outcome
      end
```  
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

    * If can only be used once but if you want another condition you can start it with 'elsif' followed by the condition. If you want a condition that defaults when all others are false you can put 'else'

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
    name = darby

    if name == "darby"
      p "Hi there"
    elsif name == "dana"
      p "Howdy"
    else
      p "Hey"
    end
```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

    * You can use logical operators for conditionals. You can also use comparison operators to compare values, string, etc.
